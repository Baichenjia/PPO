## The basic algorithm of policy gradients

Use Tensorflow 2.0.

The default environment is HalfCheetah.

The pre-trained model has saved.

## VPG

`core.py` and `vpg.py` are from openAI spinning up.

`core_tf` and `vpg_tf.py` are written by tf 2.0


## PPO

`core.py` and `ppo.py` are from openAI spinning up.

`core_tf` and `ppo_tf.py` are written by tf 2.0
